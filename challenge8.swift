Question:
Create a function called walk which will take two parameters and will return a String.
The first parameter should be named direction and will be of type String, the argument label should be set as _.
The second parameter should be named steps and will be of type Int, the argument label should be set as _.
Inside the function return a string on which direction you have walked and how many steps did you take. Don’t forget to type cast steps
The format of the return statement should be: 
return "You have walked " + String(steps) + " steps to the " + direction
Then, create a String called resultStr and assign to it the function and what data you want to display. 
Finally, print the contents of resultStr.
As an example let’s assume that direction is “North” and steps is 5. The resulting output should be:
You have walked 5 steps to the North

*/
func walk(_ direction:String, _ steps:Int) -> String{
    return "You have walked " + String(steps) + " steps to the " + direction
}

var resultStr:String = walk("East", 10)
print(resultStr)
