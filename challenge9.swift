/*

Question:
First let’s create a class called Pets and assign some variables to it.
It should have a name of type String and age of type Int.
You can go ahead and assign default values to your variables, name should be “” and age should be 0.
Next, let’s create a function called feed() and have it print “\(name) has been fed”.
Then, create a function called clean() and have it print “\(name) has taken a bath”.
Then, create a function called play() and have it print “\(name) enjoyed playing with you”.
Then, create a function called sleep() and have it print “\(name) went to sleep”.
Save your class and move on to the next step.
Finally, create a variable named pet of type Pets and assign whatever you want for its name property.
Call your pet variable and call the functions to test out the app.

    var name:String = ""
    var age:Int = 0
